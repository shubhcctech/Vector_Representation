# Vector_Representation
This project contains implementations of various computational geometry algorithms. Below is an overview of the project structure:
 
## Project Structure
 
### Folders
 
1. **headers**: This folder contains header files for classes and functions used in the project. These headers provide declarations for various geometric entities and operations.
 
<hr>
 
 
2. **src**: The source folder contains the implementation files corresponding to the header files in the `headers` folder. It includes the definitions of classes and functions for performing geometric computations.
 
*VectorOperations.cpp:*
 
1. **Constructor and Destructor**:
   - Defines constructors for creating geometric vectors with specified coordinates and a default constructor.
   - Includes a destructor, although it's not needed in this case as there are no dynamically allocated resources.
 
2. **Equality Operator**:
   - Overloads the equality operator (`==`) to check if two vectors are equal by comparing their x, y, and z coordinates.
 
3. **Vector Operations**:
   - Provides methods to perform vector operations such as dot product, cross product, magnitude calculation, and normalization.
   - Overloads arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) to support addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, and scalar division of vectors.
   - Includes methods for setting the length of a vector, adding/subtracting scalar values, and multiplying/dividing by a scalar.
 
4. **Distance Calculation**:
   - Calculates the distance between two vectors and the distance between a vector and a plane.
 
5. **Angle Calculation**:
   - Computes the angle between two vectors and the angle between a vector and a plane.
 
6. **Direction Cosines**:
   - Calculates the direction cosines of a vector.
 
7. **Matrix Multiplication**:
   - Performs vector-matrix multiplication.
 
8. **Projection**:
   - Projects a vector onto another vector and projects a vector onto a plane.

3. **output**: This folder is intended to store any output generated by the program. For example, if the program writes results to files, those files would be stored here.
